# Hello 👋, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

Hi! I'm **Trickster**, an old and **rusty** developer. I consider myself a *curious* and *self-directed* individual.  

## What's my development setup?

- 💻 My laptop usually runs on **MacOS**, but sometimes it looks like **Ubuntu Server**.
- 🛠️ Some of the tools I use are **RusrRover**, **PyCharm**, and **VSCode** for IDE, and all kind of development.
- 💬 For team communications, I mostly use **communication apps**.
- 🔀 For version control, I use **GitHub** or **GitLab** or **Git[placeholder]**.
- 🐳 For containerization, I use **containers**. 
- 🗃️ For databases, I mainly use **database**.
- 💻 For all my tools developmnet, I use some **programming language**.
- 🚀 For ci/cd I use **CI/CD**.
- ☁️ For production deployments I use **AWS**.

## Let's connect!

If you'd like to get in touch, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/).  I'm always happy to chat with other developers or people interested in technology. Let's learn and grow together!

Also, feel free to browse my GitHub profile and check out some of the projects I've worked on. While some of them may not completely reflect my current skill set, I believe they provide a glimpse into how I approached development problems earlier in my career. Keep in mind that I am no longer doing freelance or side projects, as my current contract forbids it.

Thank you for taking the time to read through my profile. I look forward to hearing from you!
